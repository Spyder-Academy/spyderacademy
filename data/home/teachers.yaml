  introduction: "Spyder Academy was born out of frustration with the low-quality of trading education available today. Our community is purely focused on education. We understand the pain of new traders - losses, mental fatigue, and almost giving up. Having overcome these obstacles, we pay it forward by helping serious traders at a deeply personal level.
<br/><br/>
Our instructors come from various backgrounds, having mentored 200+ people at Fortune 500 companies. We have traders covering different trading styles. What unites us is our shared desire to teach. We teach our strategies, why we enter and exit trades, and the rules you need to trade successfully.
<br/><br/>
Imagine a time when you're making more money from trading than from your current job. A time when you're free to do the things that truly make you happy. A time when you're consistently gaining profits and have conquered the mental side of trading.
<br/><br/>
That's why we trade. And we hope to teach you how to trade. Join us on this journey, and we look forward to helping you achieve your goals."
