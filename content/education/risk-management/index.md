## Set Your Trading Budget
Decide how much of your overall financial resources you're willing to risk on trading. A common rule of thumb is to never risk more than 1-2% of your trading account on a single trade. This helps to ensure that even a single loss does not significantly impact your ability to continue trading.

## Use Stop-Loss Orders
A stop-loss order is an order placed with a broker to buy or sell a specific stock once the stock reaches a certain price. It's designed to limit an investor's loss on a position.

## Diversification
Diversification is a risk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of investments will, on average, yield higher returns and pose a lower risk.

## Position Sizing
Position sizing is an important aspect of risk management. It refers to the size of a position within your portfolio, or the amount invested in a particular security and how much risk is associated with it. It can help a trader to limit potential losses on a single trade.

## Risk/Reward Ratio 
The risk/reward ratio marks the prospective reward an investor can earn for every dollar they risk on an investment. Many investors use risk/reward ratios to compare the expected returns of an investment with the amount of risk they must undertake to earn these returns.

## Regular Monitoring and Adjustments
Regular monitoring of your trades and adjustments based on market conditions and performance are key. Markets are dynamic and can change quickly, so it's important to be flexible and ready to adapt your strategy as necessary.

## Emotional Discipline 
Emotional discipline is critical in trading. Fear and greed can significantly influence your trading decisions. Having a well-thought-out trading plan and sticking to it is crucial, regardless of what the market does and how it might tempt you to break your own rules.


Remember, the objective of risk management is not to avoid losses entirely, but to limit them and make sure they do not impair your overall trading capital. Risk management goes hand in hand with your trading strategy, and both should be defined before you begin to trade. It's also important to regularly review and adjust your risk management strategy, just like your trading strategy, to ensure it remains effective.
