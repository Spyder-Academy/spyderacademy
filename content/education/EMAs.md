## Introduction to Moving Averages 
EMA stands for exponential moving average. This is really similar to an SMA (simple moving average) in the fact that it measures the trend direction over a certain period of time. An SMA calculates the average price of a set amount of candles over a certain period of time. An EMA does the same, however it places more weight on the most recent candles and responds more quickly to price changes; this makes it the preferred choice of many day traders.

## What Are the 9 and 21 EMA in Day Trading?
The 9 and 21 EMA are specific settings for exponential moving averages. The 9 EMA represents the average price over the past 9 periods, while the 21 EMA represents the average over the past 21 periods. These specific settings are used because they are effective in identifying short-term price trends and potential reversal points.

## Using EMAs in Day Trading
- **Identifying Trends**: The relationship between the 9 EMA and the 21 EMA can tell you a lot about the current trend. If the 9 EMA is above the 21 EMA, this typically signals an uptrend. Conversely, if the 9 EMA is below the 21 EMA, this usually suggests a downtrend. As a rule, 8 EMA < 21 EMA < 50 EMA = Strong bearish trend and 8 EMA > 21 EMA > 50EMA = Strong bullish trend.
- **Spotting Reversals**: When the 9 and 21 EMA lines cross, it could indicate a trend reversal. A bullish crossover occurs when the 9 EMA crosses above the 21 EMA, suggesting a potential long entry point. A bearish crossover is when the 9 EMA crosses below the 21 EMA, indicating a potential short entry point.
- **Assessing Strength of the Trend**: The distance between the 9 and 21 EMA can indicate the strength of the trend. The wider the gap, the stronger the trend. A narrowing gap may suggest the trend is weakening, and a reversal might be imminent.

Here is an example chart with the 9, 21, and 50 EMAs. 
![Chart setup with 9/21/50 EMAs](images/EMA_img3.png)
- Blue line is the 9EMA, pink line is the 21EMA, yellow line is the 50EMA 
- This is a textbook example of retracing back to the 9EMA before rejecting and continuing the move down. 
- Entering after the testing candle closes and get the rejection that I am looking for and trim along the way down. (ALWAYS trim into strength)
- In terms of stops, a close over the EMAs would invalidate the trade. 

## Risk Management
While the 9, 21, and 50 EMA strategy can be a very powerful tool, it's important to remember that no strategy is perfect. There will always be false signals. Aways have a plan for managing risk, which should include setting stop-loss levels and deciding in advance how much you are willing to risk on any single trade.
