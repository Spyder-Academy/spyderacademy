Let's dive into the exciting – and occasionally confusing – world of Palantir and see what's what.

**Palantir: Two Software Superstars**

Palantir has two main products: Gotham and Foundry. Think of Gotham as the super-secret agent of the data world, helping intelligence agencies fight bad guys and stay ahead of the curve.  Foundry, on the other hand, is more of a business-minded data guru, helping companies like healthcare providers and financial institutions make smarter decisions and find new opportunities.
