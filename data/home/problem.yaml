  - fear: "I feel utterly <strong class='text-danger'>lost</strong> in the market's chaos."
  - fear: "The fear of financial <strong class='text-danger'>failure</strong> haunts me constantly."
  - fear: "Every trade feels like a blind <strong class='text-danger'>gamble</strong>, shaking me to the core."
  - fear: "My emotions swing from hope to <strong class='text-danger'>despair</strong> in an instant."
  - fear: "Nothing I try seems to work, I'm <strong class='text-danger'>starved</strong> for real wisdom."
