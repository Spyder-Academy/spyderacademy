**From Baking Soda to…That Other Thing**

It all started in 1846 with John Dwight and his wife, Elizabeth, who were like the Steve Jobs and Wozniak of baking soda. They saw its potential, and their company, Church & Dwight, took off. In 1865, they acquired Arm & Hammer, a move that solidified their position as cleaning and personal care powerhouses.  They kept building their portfolio over the years, adding brands like Trojan (condoms), Nair (hair removal), OxiClean (stain remover), and Spinbrush (toothbrushes).  Talk about a diverse range of offerings!

**How Does Church & Dwight Make All This Money?**

They're basically a one-stop shop for all your everyday needs. They make money by selling these products to us, you know, the people who can't live without baking soda, stain removers, and…well, you get the picture.
