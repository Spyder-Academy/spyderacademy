# WHAT IS THE STOCK MARKET?

The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place. Think of it as a grand marketplace for trading pieces of ownership in businesses.

When you hear people refer to the “the stock market” they’re generally talking about one of the major stock exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the NASDAQ. It’s important to understand that these aren’t actual physical places; most trading today happens electronically. 


# WHY DO COMPANIES ISSUE STOCKS?

Companies issue stocks to raise money. When a company wants to grow, it might need to invest in new equipment, or hire more staff, or expand into new regions. All of these activities require capital (money), and issuing stocks is one way to get it.

This process usually starts with an initial public offering, or IPO, where a company sells shares to the public for the first time. After the IPO, these shares can be bought and sold on the stock market. 

In return for buying stocks (also called shares), investors gain partial ownership in the company. This means they might get a say in how the company is run (depending on the type of stock they own), and they might also receive a portion of the company's profits, in the form of dividends. 


# STOCK EXCHANGES AND HOW THEY WORK

A stock exchange is a regulated marketplace where people come together to buy and sell shares. Exchanges bring together buyers and sellers and determine the price of a stock using an auction process. 

For example, let's say you want to buy shares of Company X. You place an order through a broker, indicating how many shares you want to buy and the maximum price you're willing to pay. This order goes to the exchange, where it's matched with a sell order for the same stock. If the prices match, the exchange facilitates the trade.

KEY MARKET PARTICIPANTS

Several different types of participants are active in the stock market:



* Investors: These are individuals or entities buying shares in a company. They might be individuals investing for their personal portfolios, or institutional investors like mutual funds or pension funds.
* Brokers: Brokers act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. When you want to buy a stock, you usually do so through a broker, who executes the trade on your behalf.
* Market Makers: These are firms that help ensure that trades can be executed smoothly. They do this by standing ready to buy or sell a particular stock at publicly quoted prices, which helps to keep markets liquid.
* Regulators: These are entities that oversee the stock market to ensure fair practices. In the U.S., for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a key regulator.

This is a high-level overview of the stock market. As we delve deeper into other sections, you'll gain a better understanding of how each piece fits into the bigger picture, helping you navigate the world of investing with more confidence.


# Basic Terminology and Concepts


## Learn the Vocabulary

**Spyder Academy EDU**

Stocks, Shares, and Equity

These three terms—stocks, shares, and equity—are often used interchangeably, but there are slight differences.



* Stock: This term refers to the total capital raised by a company through the issuance of shares. When you invest in a company's stock, you are buying a piece of the company.
* Share: A share represents a unit of ownership in a company. If a company has issued 1,000 shares and you own 100, you own 10% of the company. 
* Equity: This term is broader in scope. It represents ownership interest in a company and can include stocks and other forms of ownership, such as stock options.

Market Capitalization

Market capitalization (often shortened to market cap) is the total value of all a company's shares of stock. It's calculated by multiplying the company's share price by the total number of its outstanding shares. 

Market cap is a quick way to gauge a company's size and growth potential. Companies are often categorized as small-cap, mid-cap, or large-cap, with small-cap companies generally seen as more risky and large-cap companies seen as more stable.

Dividends and Stock Splits



* Dividends: These are payments made by a corporation to its shareholders, usually in the form of cash or additional shares. Dividends are a way for companies to distribute a portion of their earnings back to their shareholders. Not all companies pay dividends, especially those in growth phases where they prefer to reinvest all earnings back into the business.
* Stock Splits: A stock split is a decision by a company's board of directors to increase the number of shares that are outstanding by issuing more shares to current shareholders. For example, in a 2-for-1 stock split, each shareholder receives an additional share for each share they already own. This does not change the overall value of the company; it just distributes it over more shares, making each share less expensive.

Indices and Benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500, Dow Jones, Nasdaq)

An index is a group of stocks that represents a segment of the stock market. These are often used as benchmarks to track the performance of the market or a particular sector of the market. 



* S&P 500: This index includes 500 of the largest companies listed on the stock exchanges in the U.S. It's often used as a proxy for the overall U.S. stock market.
* Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA): This index consists of 30 large, publicly-owned companies based in the U.S. Despite having fewer companies, the Dow is still commonly referenced in discussions about the health of the U.S. stock market.
* NASDAQ Composite: This index includes all the companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The Nasdaq is known for having many tech companies, so the NASDAQ Composite can give a good sense of how the tech sector is performing.

Bull and Bear Markets

Bull Market: This term refers to a market condition in which the prices of securities are rising, or are expected to rise. It's named after the way a bull attacks—charging with its horns up. In a bull market, investors are optimistic and confident, expecting good results.

Bear Market: This is the opposite of a bull market. It's a market condition in which the prices of securities are falling, and widespread pessimism causes the negative sentiment to be self-sustaining. The term is derived from the way a bear attacks - swiping its paws downward. During a bear market, investors often try to sell off their stocks to avoid further losses, creating a cycle of negativity and further downward pressure on stock prices. 

These market conditions can last for months or even years, and can be a normal part of the economic cycle. Recognizing whether the market is more “bullish” or “bearish” can help inform investment strategies. However, predicting market movements with certainty is extremely difficult, which is why many investors choose strategies that aim to grow their investments over the long term, regardless of short-term market fluctuations.

# Common and Preferred Stocks



* Common Stocks: This is the most common type of shares that investors buy. Owners of common stock may get voting rights in the company, allowing them to participate in corporate decisions. They also may receive dividends, but this is not guaranteed and depends on the company's profits and dividend policy. Common stockholders are last in line to receive any remaining assets if the company goes bankrupt.
* Preferred Stocks: Preferred stockholders have a higher claim on dividends and assets. This means they get paid dividends before common stockholders, and if the company goes bankrupt, they're more likely to receive a portion of the assets. However, preferred stockholders usually don't get voting rights in the company.


# Bonds and Other Fixed-Income Securities

Bonds are a type of fixed-income instrument. Companies or governments issue bonds to raise money. When you buy a bond, you are essentially lending money to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the bond's face value when it matures.

Bonds are generally considered less risky than stocks. If a company goes bankrupt, bondholders are paid before stockholders. However, the trade-off is that bonds usually offer lower potential returns than stocks.


# Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Mutual Funds 



* Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): These are funds that track an index, sector, commodity, or other assets, but can be bought and sold like a common stock on a stock exchange. ETFs offer an easy way to diversify your portfolio without having to buy each individual stock or bond.
* Mutual Funds: These are investment vehicles managed by professionals. When you invest in a mutual fund, your money is pooled together with other investors' money to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. Mutual funds are not traded on an exchange and their price is calculated once at the end of the trading day.


# Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives 



* Options: These are contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset (like a stock) at a specified price within a certain period of time. Options can be used for various purposes, including hedging risk, generating income, or speculating on price movements.
* Futures: A futures contract is a legal agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity or asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Futures are used to hedge the price movement of the underlying asset to help prevent losses from unfavorable price changes.
* Other Derivatives: These are financial instruments like swaps, forwards, or contracts for difference (CFDs), whose values are derived from underlying assets like stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indices.

Each type of security serves different investment needs and will be suitable for different types of investors depending on their risk tolerance, investment horizon, and investment goals. As we delve deeper into the subsequent sections, we'll explore some of these securities, particularly stocks and options, in more detail.

# INTRODUCTION

Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating a security in an attempt to measure its intrinsic value by examining related economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors.


# Understanding Financial Statements

At the heart of fundamental analysis is the company's financial statements. Here are the three main ones you need to know:



* Income Statement: This provides information about a company's revenues, costs, and expenses, giving you the net income or the profit of the company over a specific period.
* Balance Sheet: This provides a snapshot of a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time. Assets should equal liabilities plus shareholders' equity; this is what's meant when people say the balance sheet "balances".
* Cash Flow Statement: This shows how changes in the balance sheet and income affect cash and cash equivalents. It also breaks the analysis down to operating, investing, and financing activities.

Understanding these financial statements can help you gauge a company's financial health and profitability.


# Key Financial Ratios

There are several financial ratios and metrics that investors use to evaluate company performance and financial stability. Here are a few key ones:



* Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: This is calculated as a company's current share price divided by its earnings per share (EPS). It shows how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings. A high P/E ratio could suggest that a stock's price is high relative to earnings and possibly overvalued, whereas a low P/E might indicate the opposite.
* Return on Equity (ROE): This measures a corporation's profitability by revealing the profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It's calculated by dividing net income by shareholder's equity.
* Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio: This measures a company's financial leverage and is calculated by dividing its total liabilities by shareholder equity. It indicates what proportion of equity and debt the company is using to finance its assets.
* Earnings per Share (EPS): This is the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. It serves as an indicator of a company's profitability.
* Dividend Yield: This is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price.


# Company’s Business Model and Industry Analysis

Understanding the company's business model—how it makes money—is crucial. It's also important to understand the industry in which it operates and how it compares to its competitors. This involves looking at factors like industry growth trends, market share, competition, and how the company is positioned within the industry.


# Economic Factors

Finally, the broader economic environment impacts all businesses. This includes factors like economic growth, interest rates, inflation, and unemployment. For example, in an expanding economy, businesses may see an increased demand for their products, which could lead to higher stock prices.

Fundamental analysis involves a lot of data gathering, but it's an essential part of making informed investment decisions. It helps you understand not only what's happening with a company now, but also what you might expect in the future.


# Technical Analysis


## What Do The Lines Mean?

# INTRODUCTION

Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume. Unlike fundamental analysis, which looks at a company's intrinsic value, technical analysis focuses on patterns of price movements, trading signals, and various other analytical charting tools.


# Chart Types 

Charts are essential tools for technical traders. Here are the main types you need to know:



* Line Charts: The simplest type of chart, a line chart plots the closing prices of a security over a specified time period.
* Bar and Column Charts: These charts provide more detail. Each bar shows the opening, closing, high, and low prices for a specific period.
* Candlestick Charts: These charts show the same information as a bar chart, but in a more graphical format that provides more detailed insights at a glance.


# Trend Analysis

One of the key concepts in technical analysis is that of a trend, which is essentially the direction that a security is moving. There are three types of trends:



* Uptrend: Higher highs and higher lows.
* Downtrend: Lower highs and lower lows.
* Sideways/Horizontal trend: The price is neither increasing nor decreasing significantly.

Recognizing the trend can help you to make predictions about future price movements.


# Support and Resistance



* Support: This refers to the price level at which demand is thought to be strong enough to prevent the price from declining further.
* Resistance: This refers to the price level at which selling is thought to be strong enough to prevent the price from rising further.

These levels are where the price tends to bounce back, and they can be used to identify potential buying and selling opportunities.


# Technical Indicators

Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on a security's price and/or volume. The results are used to predict future price changes. Here are a few common ones:



* Moving Averages: This is an average of the security's price over a specific number of periods. This can help to identify trends.
* Relative Strength Index (RSI): This measures the speed and change of price movements and can help identify if a security is overbought or oversold.
* Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): This is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price.


# Chart Patterns

Chart patterns are graphical representations of security prices that many traders believe can predict future price movement. These include Head and Shoulders, Double Top/Bottom, Triangles, Flags, and others.

Technical analysis can be a helpful tool, but it's important to remember that it's just one method of analyzing securities. Many traders use a combination of both fundamental and technical analysis to inform their trading decisions.


# Volume Analysis

Volume refers to the number of shares or contracts that trade over a given period of time, usually a day. The higher the volume, the more active the security. Analyzing volume can help traders confirm the strength of a price move and understand the liquidity of a stock.

Here's how volume can be analyzed in various scenarios:



* Trend Confirmation: A significant price increase or decrease with high volume may indicate the start of a new trend. On the other hand, a price move with low volume might be less significant.
* Price Reversals: An increase in volume can often signal an upcoming price reversal. For example, if a stock is in an uptrend but the volume is declining, it may indicate that the trend is about to reverse.
* Breakouts: Volume can help confirm a breakout. If a security moves above a resistance level or below a support level with an increase in volume, it might indicate a valid breakout.
* Bullish vs. Bearish Volume: Bullish volume occurs when the volume increases with a price increase, and decreases when the price decreases. Bearish volume, on the other hand, occurs when volume increases as price decreases, and decreases when price increases.

The analysis of volume is a major part of market indicators and helps traders to confirm the quality of a current trend or signal. Volume should move with the trend. If prices are moving in an upward trend, volume should increase (and vice versa). If the previous relationship between volume and price movements starts to deteriorate, it is usually a sign of weakness in the trend.

# INTRODUCTION

Please note, this is a complex topic with inherent risks, and it's important to fully understand the mechanics and potential consequences before engaging in options trading.

Options are financial derivatives that give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset (often shares of stock) at a set price, within a specified period. There are two types of options: calls and puts.


# Understanding Call and Put Options



* Call Options: Buying a call option gives you the right (but not the obligation) to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price (the strike price) within a certain time frame (before the expiration date). Traders buy call options when they believe the price of the underlying asset will increase.
* Put Options: Buying a put option gives you the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying security at the strike price before the expiration date. Traders buy put options when they believe the price of the underlying asset will decrease.


# Options Building Blocks



* In-the-Money, At-the-Money, and Out-of-the-Money Options: These terms refer to the relationship between an option's strike price and the current price of the underlying asset.
* Option Greeks: These are measures of risk involved in an options contract. They are denoted by Greek letters and include delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho.
* Implied Volatility: This is a measure of how much the markets think the price of a security will move over the life of the option.
* Option Chains: This is a listing of all available option contracts, both puts and calls, for a given underlying security.
* Exercising Options: This involves deciding whether to buy/sell the underlying asset or to let the option expire worthless.
* Options Settlement: This involves understanding the process and implications of settling an option contract, which can be physically settled (delivery of the underlying asset) or cash-settled.


# Options Pricing

Option prices, also known as premiums, are influenced by a number of factors:



* Underlying Price: The price of the underlying asset directly influences the price of the associated option.
* Strike Price: The price at which the option allows you to buy or sell the underlying asset.
* Time to Expiration: The time remaining until the option contract expires. Generally, the more time remaining until expiration, the higher the premium.
* Volatility: The price fluctuation of the underlying asset. Higher volatility usually leads to higher premiums because it suggests a greater possibility for profitable trades.
* Interest Rates: Higher interest rates increase the cost of holding an option and, therefore, the premium.


# Options Trading Strategies

There are many strategies in options trading, ranging from simple to complex. Here are a few examples:



* Covered Call: This strategy involves owning the underlying asset and selling a call option on that asset. It's used to generate income from the option premium.
* Protective Put: This strategy involves owning the underlying asset and buying a put option. This is done as an insurance against a decrease in the asset's price.
* Bull Spread: This strategy involves buying and selling two options of the same type that have the same expiration but different strike prices. It is used when a moderate rise in the price of the underlying asset is expected.
* Bear Spread: Similar to the bull spread, but used when a moderate fall in the price of the underlying asset is expected.
* Straddle: This strategy involves buying a call and a put option on the same asset with the same strike price and expiration. It's used when you expect a big move in the asset's price but are unsure of the direction.


# Risks and Rewards of Options

Options can be used for hedging, income generation, and directional betting, but they come with risks. For buyers, the risk is limited to the premium paid, but they can lose this entire investment if the option expires worthless. Sellers, on the other hand, have potentially unlimited risk because they're obligated to buy/sell the underlying asset at the strike price if the buyer decides to exercise the option.

Options trading requires a good understanding of the stock market, the specific security, and the contract itself. It's important to know your risk tolerance and investment goals before diving into options trading.

Remember, options trading is not suitable for all investors due to the inherent risks, and it's recommended to practice and study extensively before engaging in options trading.

# INTRODUCTION

There are various styles and strategies that traders use, which are usually based on their risk tolerance, time commitment, and profit goals. Below, we'll explore some of the most common ones.


# Day Trading

Day traders buy and sell securities within a single day, attempting to capitalize on short-term price movements. It's a full-time job as it requires continuous monitoring of the markets and quick decision-making. Day trading strategies often involve technical analysis and high-volume trading.


# Swing Trading 

Swing traders take advantage of 'swings' in the prices of assets. They typically hold positions for a period of days to weeks, aiming to profit from short- to medium-term price patterns. Swing trading combines elements of day trading and trend trading, focusing on momentum and using technical analysis to identify trading opportunities.


# Scalping

Scalping is a high-speed trading strategy that involves making many small-profit trades rather than waiting for a single trade to develop a larger profit. Scalpers often trade in and out of a stock within minutes, or even seconds, aiming to take advantage of quick price changes.


# Momentum Trading 

Momentum traders focus on stocks that are moving significantly in one direction on high volume. They take short-term positions to take advantage of momentum in the stock's price.


# High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

High-frequency trading is an automated trading platform that large investment banks, hedge funds, and institutional investors employ. It uses powerful computers to transact a large number of orders at extremely high speeds. These high-frequency trading platforms allow traders to execute millions of orders and scan multiple markets and exchanges in a matter of seconds, thus giving institutions that use the platforms a huge advantage in the open market.


# Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic trading uses a computer program that follows a defined set of instructions (an algorithm) to place a trade. The trades, in theory, can generate profits at a speed and frequency that is impossible for a human trader.

Each trading style has its own set of risks and rewards and requires a different skill set and approach. When choosing a trading style, individuals should consider their personal goals, risk tolerance, and the amount of time they can devote to trading. It's always a good idea to practice a trading strategy before implementing it, to understand how it works in different market conditions.


# News-Based Trading

Traders using this strategy will closely follow news releases, and place trades based on how they believe the market will respond to this news.




# Risk Management

# INTRODUCTION

Risk management in trading refers to the identification, analysis, and acceptance or mitigation of trading risks. It's an essential component of your broader trading strategy, aimed at minimizing potential losses.


# Set Your Trading Budget

Decide how much of your overall financial resources you're willing to risk on trading. A common rule of thumb is to never risk more than 1-2% of your trading account on a single trade. This helps to ensure that even a single loss does not significantly impact your ability to continue trading.


# Use Stop-Loss Orders

A stop-loss order is an order placed with a broker to buy or sell a specific stock once the stock reaches a certain price. It's designed to limit an investor's loss on a position.


# Diversification

Diversification is a risk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of investments will, on average, yield higher returns and pose a lower risk.


# Position Sizing

Position sizing is an important aspect of risk management. It refers to the size of a position within your portfolio, or the amount invested in a particular security and how much risk is associated with it. It can help a trader to limit potential losses on a single trade.


# Risk/Reward Ratio 

The risk/reward ratio marks the prospective reward an investor can earn for every dollar they risk on an investment. Many investors use risk/reward ratios to compare the expected returns of an investment with the amount of risk they must undertake to earn these returns.


# Regular Monitoring and Adjustments

Regular monitoring of your trades and adjustments based on market conditions and performance are key. Markets are dynamic and can change quickly, so it's important to be flexible and ready to adapt your strategy as necessary.


# Emotional Discipline 

Emotional discipline is critical in trading. Fear and greed can significantly influence your trading decisions. Having a well-thought-out trading plan and sticking to it is crucial, regardless of what the market does and how it might tempt you to break your own rules.

Remember, the objective of risk management is not to avoid losses entirely, but to limit them and make sure they do not impair your overall trading capital. Risk management goes hand in hand with your trading strategy, and both should be defined before you begin to trade. It's also important to regularly review and adjust your risk management strategy, just like your trading strategy, to ensure it remains effective.

Economic calendars provide schedules of economic events and data releases that could impact financial markets. Traders use them to anticipate market movements and plan their trades accordingly. Most trading platforms provide economic calendars, and they can also be found on financial news websites.


# Stock Scanners

Stock scanners are tools used by traders to filter stocks based on user-defined metrics. They can help you scan the market in real-time and identify trading opportunities. Examples include Trade-Ideas and Finviz.


# Social Trading Networks

Social trading networks allow traders to network, follow, and learn from each other. They can be a valuable source of ideas and insights, especially for new traders. Examples include Twitter and StockTwits.


# Trading Journals

A trading journal is a record where traders document their trades. The journal includes the reasons for each trade, the strategy used, and the outcome. Reviewing the journal can help traders identify their strengths and weaknesses and improve their strategies. Examples of journaling tools include Edgewonk, TradeVue, or even just a good ‘ol fashioned pen and paper. 


# Paper Trading Simulators

Paper trading simulators provide a risk-free way to practice trading. They simulate real trading with virtual money. This can be a great way to test strategies and learn about markets without risking real money. Examples include the paper trading accounts offered by many trading platforms.

Remember, while these tools and resources can be extremely helpful, they do not guarantee success. They should be used as part of a broader trading strategy that includes risk management, continuous learning, and regular performance reviews.

# INTRODUCTION

A trading plan is a comprehensive decision-making tool for your trading activity. It helps you to define what, why, when, and how you will trade. Here are some components you should consider:


# Define Your Trading Goals

Your goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). They could be financial goals, like making a certain amount of profit each month, or developmental goals, like learning a new trading strategy.


# Select Tradable Securities 

Decide which markets and securities you are interested in trading. This could be based on your knowledge, interest, or the specific characteristics of the securities (like volatility, liquidity, etc.).


# Establish Your Risk Tolerance

Determine how much risk you're willing to take on in your trading. This can be expressed as a percentage of your trading capital and can guide how much money you're willing to risk on any single trade.


# Develop Your Trading Strategy 

Your trading strategy is the set of rules that guide your trading decisions. It could be based on technical analysis, fundamental analysis, or a combination of both. Your strategy should clearly state the conditions under which you will enter and exit trades.


# Create Your Money Management Rules

Money management rules help you manage your trading capital effectively to achieve your trading goals while managing your risks. This could include rules on diversification, position sizing, and use of stop losses.


# Set Up Your Trading Routine

A trading routine helps you manage your time and ensure that you complete all the necessary tasks each trading day. This could include times for market analysis, trading, review of your trades, and continuing education.


# Regular Review and Improvement

Regularly review your trading performance and identify areas for improvement. This could involve analyzing your successful and unsuccessful trades, assessing your decision-making process, and refining your trading plan and strategy based on your findings.

Remember, your trading plan is a living document. As you gain more experience, your plan will evolve with you. Always ensure that your plan suits your personal circumstances, risk tolerance, and trading goals. A well-constructed trading plan can help to instill discipline, reduce emotional decision-making, and improve your chances of trading success.
