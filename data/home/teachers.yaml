  introduction: "Spyder Academy was born out of frustration with the low-quality of trading education available today. Our community is purely focused on education. We understand the pain of new traders - losses, mental fatigue, and almost giving up. Having overcome these obstacles, we pay it forward by helping serious traders at a deeply personal level.
<br/><br/>
Our instructors come from various backgrounds, having mentored 200+ people at Fortune 500 companies and still studying for their Bachelor's degree. We have scalpers and traders who may take only 0-2 trades in a day. What unites us is a shared desire to teach. We teach our strategies, why we enter and exit trades, and the rules you need to trade successfully.
<br/><br/>
Imagine a time when you're making more money from trading than from your current job. A time when you're free to do the things that truly make you happy. A time when you're consistently gaining profits and have conquered the mental side of trading.
<br/><br/>
That's why we trade. And we hope to teach you how to trade. Join us on this journey, and we look forward to helping you achieve your goals."
