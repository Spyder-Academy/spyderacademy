**III.  How Does EXPD Make Money?**

It's all about fees and commissions. They charge you for all those services, making a profit by helping your stuff get where it needs to go.  It's a complex world with lots of variables, so their pricing reflects the complexity of each shipment, the distance, and the demand for their services.  They're always looking for the best deals and most efficient routes, which keeps their costs down and their profits up.

**IV.  The Bullish Case for EXPD:  Why Things Could Be Great**

* **Acquisitions:**  They're buying up other companies that add to their services and expand their reach, building an even bigger and better network. 

**V.  The Bearish Case for EXPD:  Why Things Could Get Tricky**

* **The Economy's a Wild Card:**  If the economy slows down, people buy less stuff, and that means less demand for EXPD's services.
