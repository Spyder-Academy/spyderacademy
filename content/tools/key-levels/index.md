## Yesterday's Tale: Highs, Lows, and the Closing Act

### Yesterday High (PDH):

Yesterday's MVP, the Yesterday High, represents the peak market reached the day before. Its significance lies in its role as a psychological level. A break above signals bullish strength, while falling below hints at bearish dominance.

### Yesterday Low (PDL):

Counterpart to the PDH, the Yesterday Low is the previous day's lowest point. A battleground for bulls and bears, breaching below signals bearish sentiment, while holding above indicates bullish strength.

### Yesterday Close (PDC):

The Yesterday Close marks the end of the previous day's drama. A crucial level for traders, it serves as a reference point for potential continuation or reversal cues.

## Before the Bell: Pre Market High/Low

### Pre Market High (PMH) and Pre Market Low (PML):

These levels, set before the opening bell, offer insights into early sentiment. PMH is the pre-market session's highest point, and PML is the lowest. Traders pay attention for clues before regular trading hours begin.

## Opening Act: Opening Range High/Low

### Opening Range High (ORBH) and Opening Range Low (ORBL):

Established within the first 15 minutes, ORBH and ORBL set the initial tone of the day. Breakout above ORBH signals bullish momentum, while breakdown below ORBL hints at bearish activity.

## The Lunch Act: LunchTime Range High/Low

### Lunch High and Lunch Low:

Between 12 pm and 1 pm ET, as the market grinds into the lunch hour, these levels act as support/resistance in the afternoon session.
