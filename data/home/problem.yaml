agitate:
  - fear: "I feel utterly <strong class='text-danger'>lost</strong> in the market's chaos"
  - fear: "The fear of financial <strong class='text-danger'>failure</strong> haunts me"
  - fear: "Every trade feels like a blind <strong class='text-danger'>gamble</strong>"
  - fear: "It's <strong class='text-danger'>shaking</strong> me to the core"
  - fear: "My emotions swing from hope to <strong class='text-danger'>despair</strong>"
  - fear: "Nothing I try <strong class='text-danger'>seems to work</strong>"
  - fear: "I'm <strong class='text-danger'>starved</strong> for real wisdom"
