Trading platforms are software applications that provide a way to trade financial securities online. They offer a variety of features, such as real-time quotes, charting tools, news feeds, and even premium research. 

Examples include E*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, Interactive Brokers, Robinhood, and MetaTrader.

## Charting Tools 
Charting tools are used to visually represent the price movements of trading instruments over time. They enable traders to apply various technical analysis tools and indicators to help predict future price movements. Examples include TradingView, MetaTrader, and the charting tools built into many trading platforms.

## News and Analysis Services
Staying updated with financial news is vital for traders. News can impact market conditions and cause price fluctuations. Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, and Financial Times are among the most respected financial news outlets. For analysis, services like Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool, and Morningstar can provide valuable insights.

## Economic Calendars
Economic calendars provide schedules of economic events and data releases that could impact financial markets. Traders use them to anticipate market movements and plan their trades accordingly. Most trading platforms provide economic calendars, and they can also be found on financial news websites.

## Stock Scanners
Stock scanners are tools used by traders to filter stocks based on user-defined metrics. They can help you scan the market in real-time and identify trading opportunities. Examples include Trade-Ideas and Finviz.

## Social Trading Networks
Social trading networks allow traders to network, follow, and learn from each other. They can be a valuable source of ideas and insights, especially for new traders. Examples include Twitter and StockTwits.

## Trading Journals
A trading journal is a record where traders document their trades. The journal includes the reasons for each trade, the strategy used, and the outcome. Reviewing the journal can help traders identify their strengths and weaknesses and improve their strategies. Examples of journaling tools include Edgewonk, TradeVue, or even just a good â€˜ol fashioned pen and paper. 

## Paper Trading Simulators
Paper trading simulators provide a risk-free way to practice trading. They simulate real trading with virtual money. This can be a great way to test strategies and learn about markets without risking real money. Examples include the paper trading accounts offered by many trading platforms.


Remember, while these tools and resources can be extremely helpful, they do not guarantee success. They should be used as part of a broader trading strategy that includes risk management, continuous learning, and regular performance reviews.
