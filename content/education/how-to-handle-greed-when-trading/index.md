## **🤑 GREED**

Greed is the desire for more, driven by a sense of entitlement that current market conditions will continue indefinitely.

Line always goes up.. right?

No.

**🤑 Greed can manifest in several ways:**

Overtrading, 

ignoring risk management, 

holding on to losing positions.

## **🧠 MANAGING GREED**

To minimize greed on your trading performance, consider the following strategies:

✍️ Develop a comprehensive trading plan: A well-defined trading plan, including entry, exit, and risk management criteria, can help maintain discipline and reduce emotional decision-making.

👀 Set realistic expectations: Understand that losses are an inevitable part of trading and that not every trade will be profitable. Accepting this reality can help mitigate the emotional impact of negative outcomes.

📝 Focus on process over outcomes: Prioritize adherence to your trading plan and risk management principles over short-term gains or losses. This mindset can help reduce the emotional attachment to individual trades and promote a more rational approach.

🧘‍♂️ Practice emotional awareness: Recognize the signs of fear and greed, such as hesitation, impulsivity, or excessive risk-taking, and take a step back to reassess your decisions objectively.

💪 Maintain a healthy work-life balance: Engaging in hobbies, physical activities, and maintaining social connections outside of trading can help alleviate stress and provide a more balanced perspective on trading performance.
