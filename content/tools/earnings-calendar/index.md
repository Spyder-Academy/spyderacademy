## Upcoming Earnings Calendar

Don't trade before earnings.  

Instead, trade the [IV Flush](/education/how-to-trade-the-iv-flush-strategy/) after earnings by looking at what the options market is expecting. 

Compare the actual move in premarket/after hours with the implied move, then trade the reaction when bulls/bears are both being IV crushed.  The ideal companies to trade in this scenario is when the actual post earnings move has stayed within the Implied Range.
