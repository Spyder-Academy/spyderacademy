## Test Your Strategy
Test your strategy. Look for examples where it has worked, backtest it using historical data, use a risk-free demo account. Calculate wins and losses to determine if your strategy has an edge. Learn from the results and tweak your approach accordingly.

## Manage Risk
 Manage your risk effectively. Set limits on how much you're willing to lose per trade, per day, week, or month. Use stop-loss orders to minimize losses. Risk management rules protect your account from depleting rapidly during losing streaks.

## Find your edge
Quantify your trading edge using formulas like positive expectancy. Calculate win rates, average wins and losses, and risk/reward ratios. A positive expectancy indicates a potential edge. Be patient, rinse, and repeat the process.
