**From Tissues to Diapers: The KMB Empire**

Think of it as a one-stop shop for everyday necessities. KMB's got you covered with tissues (Kleenex, Scott, Andrex – you know the drill), personal care products (Huggies, Pull-Ups, Kotex, Depend –  everything from diapers to feminine hygiene), and hygiene essentials (Cottonelle, Scott wipes, hand sanitizers –  the list goes on!).  

They're not just a local mom-and-pop shop, though. This is a global empire with products sold in over 175 countries. You'll find their brands in supermarkets, drugstores, and even online, making them a true household name.

**But how does KMB stay on top of its game?**

**Financial Performance: A Look at the Numbers**

KMB has been a steady performer, generating strong revenue and consistently growing their earnings per share. They're also known for being generous to their shareholders with consistent dividend payments –  a good sign for income-seeking investors. 

However, they've also faced challenges, including rising input costs and fluctuations in raw material prices. Despite these obstacles, KMB has demonstrated its ability to adapt and maintain a respectable profit margin.
