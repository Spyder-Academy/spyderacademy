All of the mentors bring great knowledge and expertise to the table and are always available to clarify things when something is not understood.<br/><br/>The environment they created makes traders of all levels feel comfortable and respected. I really appreciate their approach as it pertains to the psychological part of trading as it can be a very tough hurdle to overcome."

These guys really help you to understand your personal psychology when trading in the market, setting the expectation for trading cadence, etc.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a group to help you be a better trader, this is the place!"

Not only in success terms but overall, I have not been in a community that is this focused-on education.<br/><br/>I learn more than I have in years from their resources as well as their everyday live voice. I can't even stress enough how much of a good experience they bring to their discord.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 in educational terms and 10 out of 10 in the success that I have firsthand experienced from their trading methods and strategies."
