* **Regulation:** The financial industry is constantly being scrutinized by regulators, which could impact FactSet's operations. 
* **Economic Downturns:** When the economy slows down, investors tend to cut back on spending, which could affect FactSet's revenue.
* **Key Client Dependence:**  If a few big clients decide to go with another provider, it could hurt FactSet's bottom line. 
* **Valuation:** FactSet's stock price often trades at a premium to its competitors, reflecting investor confidence in the company's future. But if they fail to meet expectations, their stock price could take a hit.
