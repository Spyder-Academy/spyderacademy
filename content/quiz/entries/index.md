        question: "Why did Sith decide to take this AMD trade to go long on Oct 24?",

        answers: [
            {option: "A", desc: "Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern"}, 
            {option: "B", desc: "9ema Retest and Hold"}, 
            {option: "C", desc: "Low volume retest of the 9ema along with an IH&S pattern", correct: true}, 
            {option: "D", desc: "Reclaim of VWAP"}
        ],
        explanation: "After a reclaim of the 9ema, it is wise to wait for a retest of the 9ema on decreasing volume.  A hold of that 9ema is your signal to enter the trade.  To add confluence to this trade, look for other key levels or patterns.  In this case, a Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern had also formed."

        question: "What did Link see to go Short QQQ here on Oct 25?",
        image: "images/QQQ 2023-10-25.png",
        answers: [
            {option: "A", desc: "Bear Flag"}, 
            {option: "B", desc: "Low Volume retest of the 9ema inside a Bear Flag"}, 
            {option: "C", desc: "Following the trend"}, 
            {option: "D", desc: "All of the above", correct: true}
        ],
        explanation: "QQQ was trending downward along the 9ema on the 5min. After putting in a long pole with high sell volume, QQQ put in a bear flag, with a low volume pullback to the 9ema. The retest of the 9ema showed sellers coming back in, giving the ideal entry to go short."

        question: "Why did Sith go Long here on QQQ on Oct 23?",
        image: "images/QQQ 2023-10-23.png",
        answers: [
            {option: "A", desc: "ORB High Break and Hold."}, 
            {option: "B", desc: "Low Volume 9ema Retest."}, 
            {option: "C", desc: "9ema Retest with Buyers stepping in, along with ORB High break and hold.", correct: true}, 
            {option: "D", desc: "He got lucky."}
        ],
        explanation: "QQQ broke ORB High with large buy volume. The 9ema was then retested inside the ORB range, but buyers stepped up and bought it back up over ORB High. As long as the 9ema and ORB High are holding, this is a great setup to go long."

        question: "How did Link take 303% on this QQQ Short Trade on Dec 13?",
        image: "images/QQQ 2023-10-13.png",
        answers: [
            {option: "A", desc: "ORB Low Break and Hold."}, 
            {option: "B", desc: "Low Volume 9ema Retest."}, 
            {option: "C", desc: "Strong sell volume, followed by low volume consolidaton to retest the 9ema and ORB Low.", correct: true}, 
            {option: "D", desc: "Bear Flag."}
        ],
        explanation: "QQQ broke VWAP and the 9ema with strong sell volume. This was followed by low volume consolidation, with QQQ holding below the ORB 15min range. Entries at the 9ema here were rewarded with a nice continuation of the downtrend along the 9ema."

        question: "Sith earned bags going both long and short in QQQ on Oct 27th. What can you learn from his entries?",
        image: "images/QQQ 2023-10-27.png",
        answers: [
            {option: "A", desc: "Wait for the 9ema to break or reclaim before entering a position."}, 
            {option: "B", desc: "Check the volume supports the direction you are taking (buyers entering for longs, sellers entering for shorts)"}, 
            {option: "C", desc: "Confirm a retest of the 9ema supports your direction (low volume retest for continuation)"}, 
            {option: "D", desc: "All of the above", correct: true}
        ],
        explanation: "The morning was choppy, but the first sign of a direction only came after QQQ had 2 candle closes below the 9ema, signalling to go short.<br/><br/>That would have given a quick scalp before the 9ema was reclaimed again with buyers stepping in. The reclaim of the 9ema showed buying interest increasing in the volume bar, signalling a potential long opportunity.  <br/><br/>Later, the trend flipped again with another reclaim of the 9ema. A good entry was the low volume retest of the 9ema.  However this trade may have gone negative during the weak move up while QQQ bear flagged.  <br/><br/>If you missed that entry, another retest of the 9ema with a tweezer top formation and strong sell volume would have made the more ideal entry."
