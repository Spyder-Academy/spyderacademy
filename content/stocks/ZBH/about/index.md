**Reasons for caution:**

* **High competition:** The orthopedic market is very competitive, with other big companies fighting for market share. This can lead to pricing pressures and make it harder for ZBH to maintain its profitability.
* **Potential regulatory scrutiny:** The medical device industry is heavily regulated, and any legal or regulatory issues could impact ZBH's operations.

**Ultimately, deciding whether ZBH is a good investment for you depends on your personal investment goals, risk tolerance, and a thorough understanding of the company's business and the broader healthcare market.**
