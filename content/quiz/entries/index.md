        answers: [
            {option: "A", desc: "Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern"}, 
            {option: "B", desc: "9ema Retest and Hold"}, 
            {option: "C", desc: "Low volume retest of the 9ema along with an IH&S pattern", correct: true}, 
            {option: "D", desc: "Reclaim of VWAP"}
        ],
        explanation: "After a reclaim of the 9ema, it is wise to wait for a retest of the 9ema on decreasing volume.  A hold of that 9ema is your signal to enter the trade.  To add confluence to this trade, look for other key levels or patterns.  In this case, a Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern had also formed."

        question: "What did Link see to go Short here?",
        image: "images/QQQ 2023-10-25.png",
        answers: [
            {option: "A", desc: "Bear Flag"}, 
            {option: "B", desc: "Low Volume retest of the 9ema inside a Bear Flag"}, 
            {option: "C", desc: "Following the trend"}, 
            {option: "D", desc: "All of the above", correct: true}
        ],
        explanation: "QQQ was trending downward along the 9ema on the 5min. After putting in a long pole with high sell volume, QQQ put in a bear flag, with a low volume pullback to the 9ema. The retest of the 9ema showed sellers coming back in, giving the ideal entry to go short."
