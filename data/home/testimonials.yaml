All of the mentors bring great knowledge and expertise to the table and are always available to clarify things when something is not understood.<br/><br/>The environment they created makes traders of all levels feel comfortable and respected. I really appreciate their approach as it pertains to the psychological part of trading as it can be a very tough hurdle to overcome."
