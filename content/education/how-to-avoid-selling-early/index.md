The "selling too early" mindset is a pervasive challenge that traders often grapple with in their pursuit of success. The allure of quick profits can tempt traders to exit positions prematurely, only to find themselves on the sidelines as the trade continues its upward trajectory. While securing gains is a fundamental aspect of trading, doing so too early may lead to missed opportunities for more significant profits. 

In this exploration, we delve into strategies to navigate this common pitfall, emphasizing the importance of patience and discipline in achieving sustained success in the dynamic world of trading.


## Strategies to Navigate the Pitfall of Selling Too Early

### 1. Keep Runners: Balancing Certainty with Opportunity

Trimming a significant portion of your position at key levels, such as ORB fib targets, is a prudent strategy. This ensures that you secure profits when the market presents them. However, the concept of keeping runners involves letting a portion of your position ride the upward momentum. This approach allows traders to benefit from extended price movements while still safeguarding the majority of their profits.

##### The Balancing Act: Securing Profits and Maximizing Opportunities

This strategy requires a delicate balance. Traders must assess the market conditions, the strength of the current trend, and the potential for continued momentum. A key aspect is identifying levels or indicators that suggest a potential extension of the trend. By doing so, traders can make informed decisions on how much of their position to trim and how much to let run.

### 2. You Can't Predict Every Move: The Challenge of Regret

Traders often find themselves caught in the cycle of [regret](/education/how-to-handle-regret-in-trading/), especially when a trade continues to run after they've exited. The next logical step might be to hold onto positions longer to capture more substantial gains. However, this decision comes with its own set of challenges.

##### The Power of Journaling: Learning from Experience

Maintaining a trading journal is a powerful tool for every trader. It serves as a record of trades, outcomes, and crucially, the trader's emotions and decisions during each trade. By reviewing past trades, traders can identify patterns of behavior, recognize recurring mistakes, and pinpoint areas for improvement.

##### Adjusting Strategies: Evolving with Experience

If a trader consistently finds that their trades would have run longer had they held onto them, it's time to reevaluate their trimming strategy. This involves reassessing the criteria for trimming positions and considering whether more extended holding periods align with the trader's risk tolerance and market conditions.

### 3. Consistency Over Home Runs: Building Long-Term Success

While the allure of a remarkable 100% gain on a trade is undeniable, relying solely on capturing home runs can be a risky strategy. Instead, focusing on consistent base hits, achieving multiple 20%+ wins (with tight risks (eg 10% risk)), contributes to the longevity and growth of a trader's account.

##### Compound Growth: The Power of Consistency

Stacking up multiple consistent wins, even if they are modest in comparison to the occasional home run, can lead to significant compound growth over time. The power of consistency lies in the ability to weather market fluctuations and inevitable losses. Traders who prioritize base hits are better equipped to navigate the ups and downs of the market and sustain their trading endeavors.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, mastering the art of patience in trading involves navigating the complex landscape of deciding when to secure profits and when to let opportunities run.
