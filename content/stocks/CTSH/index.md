## Cognizant: From IT Outsourcer to Digital Dynamo

They're like the digital Sherpas, guiding businesses through the treacherous terrain of technology. 

**From Humble Beginnings to Global Powerhouse**

Cognizant started life in 1994 as a small IT outsourcing company. You know, the kind where you'd call a guy in India to fix your computer problems. But times change, and Cognizant changed with them. They realized that businesses weren't just looking for tech support; they wanted a partner to help them embrace the digital revolution.  

So, they evolved. They expanded their services to include everything from building mobile apps to managing cloud infrastructure. They even got into the exciting world of data analytics, where they help companies unlock the secrets hidden within their mountains of data.
