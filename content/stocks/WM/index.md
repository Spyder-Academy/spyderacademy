As the population grows and economies boom, the demand for waste management services is expected to skyrocket. So, is WM a good investment for your portfolio? Let's break it down.

With its vast network of collection routes, processing facilities, and landfills, WM holds a significant share of the market. While it faces competition from smaller companies, its scale and efficiency give it a strong edge.
