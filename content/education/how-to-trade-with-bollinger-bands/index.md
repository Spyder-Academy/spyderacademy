## What are Bollinger Bands?
Bollinger Bands are a popular technical indicator used by traders to identify potential buying and selling opportunities in the market. Developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s, Bollinger Bands consist of three components: the middle band (typically a simple moving average), an upper band representing two standard deviations above the middle band, and a lower band two standard deviations below. These bands dynamically adjust to market volatility, providing a visual representation of price volatility.

When price breaks outside of the bands, it’s a sign that the market is either unusually bullish or bearish.
