**But Wait, There's More! (Or, There's Also Less)**

* **Competition:  It's a Wild West Out There:** The automotive aftermarket is a crowded space, and GPC faces challenges from big players and online retailers alike.
* **Economic Blues:** If the economy takes a downturn, people might tighten their belts and skip the car repairs, which could hurt GPC.

**GPC: A Ride Worth Taking?**

Ultimately, whether GPC is a good investment is up to you. It's a company with a strong track record in a growing market. But as with any investment, there are risks to consider.
