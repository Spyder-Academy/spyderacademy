Have you ever found yourself glued to your trading screens, constantly checking the market movements and
entering and exiting trades at a rapid pace? This might be a sign of overtrading, a common pitfall that can wreak
havoc on your trading account and mental health.

Overtrading is when a trader executes too many trades, often with high frequency and low conviction, resulting in
a significant increase in transaction costs and potential losses. Overtrading can be fueled by a range of emotions,
such as fear of missing out, greed, or impulsivity, and can lead to a range of negative consequences, including
burnout, fatigue, and reduced trading performance.

One of the main dangers of overtrading is that it can erode your trading account and eat away at your profits. This
is because transaction costs, such as commissions, spreads, and slippage, can add up quickly, especially if you're
executing a large number of trades. In addition, overtrading can lead to making irrational decisions, such as
chasing losses, revenge trading, or ignoring risk management rules, which can result in significant losses.

To avoid overtrading, it's important to have a clear trading plan and strategy that includes specific entry and exit
criteria and risk management rules. It's also helpful to set realistic trading goals and limit the number of trades you
execute each day or week. Taking breaks, getting enough rest, and managing stress levels can also help prevent
overtrading and improve trading performance.

There are several things you can do to avoid overtrading and stay on track with your trading goals:

## Avoiding the Overtrading Trap

### 1. Create a Trading Plan

Crafting a clear trading plan with specific entry and exit criteria, robust risk management rules, and realistic goals is pivotal. For instance, following a specific strategy (like SORBET) and limiting yourself to a set number of tickers (e.g., SPY and TSLA) enhances focus and curtails impulsive decisions.

### 2.Trade Less

It's important to set limits on the number of trades you execute each day or week and the amount of risk
you're willing to take on each trade. This can help you stay disciplined and avoid the temptation to
overtrade.

An example that I strive for is to take just 2 trades per day. If my first trade is profitable, then can take a
second trade using profits only. And then a third trade with only those profits. The key is to ensure you lock
in the profits and don't go red on the day.

If I lose 2 trades in a row, I am done for the day. If I hit my daily goal, I am done (or ensure I don't give that
back)

### 3. Use a Trading Journal

Keeping a meticulous trading journal serves as a compass, guiding you through performance evaluation, pattern identification, and necessary strategy adjustments.

### 4. Take Breaks and Manage Stress

Taking regular breaks from trading, especially during volatile or stressful market conditions, can help you
recharge and avoid burnout. Stress and emotional turmoil can often lead to overtrading. Finding ways to manage
stress, such as exercise, meditation, or therapy, can help you maintain a healthy trading mindset.
