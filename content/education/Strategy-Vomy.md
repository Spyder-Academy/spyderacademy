The Dolphin Vomit Strategy is based on a strategy by [Saty Mahajan (SATY VOMY)](https://twitter.com/satymahajan/status/1648369109774614532?s=20).  The idea is to wait for a strong trend to develop on the 10 minute chart (although it can work on other timeframes too), based on the 8/21/34 ema's.  A Ripster style ribbon is displayed to help identify the trend.

As the ribbon develops, it starts to look like a Dolphin.  You then wait for a break of the EMAs (specifically the 48ema).  This indicates a potential reversal developing (The Vomit), and you enter the trade.  It is important to take note of any major support/resistance levels nearby as that could invalidate the 48ema break, causing a fake out.

Saty Mahajan has a great [write up](https://twitter.com/satymahajan/status/1648369109774614532?s=20) on how to trade the VOMY setup.  This strategy is traded frequently by Gobi Calls here at Spyder Academy.
