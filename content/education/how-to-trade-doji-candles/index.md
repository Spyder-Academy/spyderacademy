## Understanding Doji Candles

Doji candles are unique because they signify market indecision. These candles have open and close prices that are nearly equal, forming a cross-like shape. Traders often interpret them as a battle between bulls and bears, resulting in a potential reversal.

### Gravestone Doji

- **Appearance:** The Gravestone Doji has a long upper shadow and little to no lower shadow, resembling an upside-down "T" or tombstone.
- **Significance:** It suggests that buyers started strong but were overpowered by sellers by the close, indicating a potential bearish reversal when put in at highs.  A gravestone doji at lows can indicate sellers not able to push the price lower, and thus signal a reversal back up as a bottoming candle.

### Dragonfly Doji

- **Appearance:** The Dragonfly Doji has a long lower shadow and little to no upper shadow, resembling a dragonfly.
- **Significance:** It signals that sellers dominated early but were overcome by buyers by the close, hinting at a potential bullish reversal when put in at lows.  A dragonfly doji at highs usually signal that buyers couldnt push the price higher, thus becoming a topping candle and may indicate a reversal lower.

## Using Volume and Key Levels for Reversals

### 1. **Volume Analysis:**

- **Gravestone Doji:** 
  - High volume accompanying a Gravestone Doji reinforces the potential for a bearish reversal.
  - It indicates strong selling interest at higher levels.

- **Dragonfly Doji:** 
  - High volume alongside a Dragonfly Doji strengthens the case for a bullish reversal.
  - It shows strong buying interest, especially at lower price levels.

### 2. **Key Levels:**

- **Support and Resistance:**
  - Identify key support and resistance levels on your chart.
  - A Gravestone Doji near resistance or a Dragonfly Doji near support can strengthen reversal signals.

- **Yesterday High/Low:**
  - Check how the Doji interacts with yesterday's high or low.
  - A Gravestone Doji above yesterday's high or a Dragonfly Doji below yesterday's low enhances reversal probabilities.

## Real-Life Examples:

In the example, we see a Gravestone Doji forming near a resistance level, accompanied by increased volume. This combination suggests a potential bearish reversal. On the flip side, a Dragonfly Doji near a support level with surging volume indicates a possible bullish reversal.

## Tips for Trading Like a Pro:

1. **Confirmation is Key:**
   - Use Doji patterns as part of a comprehensive analysis, combining them with other indicators for confirmation.

2. **Risk Management:**
   - Set stop-loss and take-profit levels to manage your risk effectively.  Enter/Exit a trade based on a breach of the wicks of the doji candle.  Eg, you may consider entering long on price movement above the high of a doji (indecision breaking to the upside) with a stop if price breaks below the low of the doji.

3. **Stay Informed:**
   - Stay updated on market news and events that could impact your chosen assets.
