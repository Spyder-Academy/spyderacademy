## Yesterday's Tale: Highs, Lows, and the Closing Act

### Yesterday High (PDH):

The Yesterday High is like yesterday's MVP â€“ the highest point the market reached the day before. Why does it matter? Because it often acts as a psychological level. Break above it, and bulls might be taking charge. Fall below, and bears could be asserting dominance.

### Yesterday Low (PDL):

On the flip side, we have the Yesterday Low â€“ the lowest point from the previous day. This level is a battleground for bulls and bears. A breach below might signal bearish sentiment, while holding above could indicate bullish strength.

### Yesterday Close (PDC):

The Yesterday Close is where the curtain fell on the previous day's drama. It's like the market's way of saying, "Here's where we left off." Traders often keep an eye on this level for potential continuation or reversal cues.

## Before the Bell: Pre Market High/Low

### Pre Market High (PMH) and Pre Market Low (PML):

These are the levels where the market warms up before the opening bell. The Pre Market High is the highest point reached in the pre-market session, and the Pre Market Low is, you guessed it, the lowest point. Traders pay attention because they can offer insights into early sentiment before regular trading hours kick in.

## Opening Act: Opening Range High/Low

### Opening Range High (ORBH) and Opening Range Low (ORBL):

As the market opens its doors, the Opening Range High and Low are established within the first 15 minutes. These levels are crucial for setting the initial tone of the day. Breakout above the Opening Range High? Bulls are charging. Breakdown below the Opening Range Low? Bears are growling.

   - Incorporate these key levels into your intraday trading plan. They can act as guides for potential trades.
